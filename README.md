# Biologically Inspired Computing
Algorithms related to biologically inspired computing, optimisation and search implemented for educational purpose in coherence with course [INF3490](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF3490/).

## Implemented Algorithms/Solutions
### Multi-layer Perceptron: 
Supervised learning with a multilayer perceptron (MLP). In order to control a robotic prosthetic hand, Prosthetic hand controllers (PHCs) reads the electromyographic signals generated by contracting muscles in the under arm. 
The idea is that we can, through supervised learning, get a PHC to learn which hand movement the user of a robotic prosthetic hand wants toperform.

	* A crude and complicated implementation of an MLP as a challenge. OOP with a neuron class and no matrix functions or machine learning modules.

	* A somewhat less complicated, but crude implementation of an MLP. 2D list and no matrix functions or machine learning modules.
* [mlp_numpy](http://www.ovstegard.no/INF3490-Kompendium/#multi-layer-perceptronmpl) [:white_check_mark:](mlp_numpy/)
	* Simple two-layer MLP using numpy and matrix operations.
