# Biologically Inspired Computing
Algorithms related to biologically inspired computing, optimisation and search implemented for educational purpose in coherence with INF2220.

## Implemented Algorithms/Solutions
### Multi-layer Perceptron: 
Supervised learning with a multilayer perceptron (MLP). In order to control a robotic prosthetic hand, Prosthetic hand controllers (PHCs) reads the electromyographic signals generated by contracting muscles in the under arm. 
The idea is that we can, through supervised learning, get a PHC to learn which hand movement the user of a robotic prosthetic hand wants toperform.

	* A crude and complicated implementation of an MLP as a challenge. OOP with a neuron class and no matrix functions or machine learning modules.
